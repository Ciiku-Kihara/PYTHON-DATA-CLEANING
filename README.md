# Python-Pandas-Data-Cleaning
Google Colab notebook containing cleaned and analyzed data for a telecoms project, 5th February, 2021.

## Names of Contributors
Faith Kihara

## Description
This repository contains a Google Collaboratory notebook that has Python code that I used to clean and analyze datasets
that contain some information about the telecommunications industry in Cote d'Ivoire. This was a practice project that was aimed to 
help me understand basic Python data cleaning and analysis concepts. 
As a data scientist, I was expected to provide a strategy to help MTN Cote d'Ivoire upgrade its technology infrastructure.

## Setup Instructions
To make changes to my code, just fork my work.

## Technologies Used
I used Python to clean and analyze the data. I particularly used the Pandas library.

## Support and contact details
If you run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns please do make a contribution to the code or 
message me via LinkedIn. www.linkedin.com/in/faith-kihara-825b57156
